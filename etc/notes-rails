# basic rails conventions:
rails generate controller Names
#                             ^ controller names are plural
rails generate model Name
#                        ^ model names are singular

# set variable/label in view, great for dynamic content:
<% provide(:name, "value") %>

# test if dom element exists and has certain inner html:
test "should ..." do
	get ...
	assert_select "element", "inner html"
end

# blank? method, added by Rails:
>> "".blank?
=> true
>> "      ".empty?
=> false
>> "      ".blank?
=> true
>> nil.blank?
=> true

# in model:
has_secure_password  # requires 'bcrypt' gem
# generates password_digest (hash) in database for model

# debugging with 'byebug' gem:
# add ...
debugger
# ... to action in controller to get start byebug in server console
# provides interactive access to request variables and the like

# reset database with rails:
rails db:migrate:reset

# use secure SSL in production:
# uncomment 'config.force_ssl = true' in file config/environments/production.rb
# SSl will have to be enabled (via purchased certificate) on production server
# heroku does this automatically and for free due to its SSL certificate
# "If you want to run SSL on a custom domain, such as www.example.com, refer to Herokuâ€™s documentation on SSL.":
# http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl

# using puma as webserver for services that don't do this by default:
# https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up#code-production_webserver_config
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server

# when trying to render a list of models, calling render function on complete list (with apropriate existing partial):
# "Here Rails infers that @users is a list of User objects;
#  moreover, when called with a collection of users,
#  Rails automatically iterates through them and renders each one with the
#  _user.html.erb partial (inferring the name of the partial from the name of the
#  class). The result is the impressively compact code in Listing 10.52."

# built-in rails helper for getting current time and date taking in account the current timezone:
Time.zone.now

# "The way to set a query parameter in Rails is to include a hash in the named route:"
edit_account_activation_url(@user.activation_token, email: @user.email)
=> account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit?email=foo%40example.com

# create url friendly string:
CGI.escape("string !?")

# set timezone:
# config/application.rb :
config.time_zone = "Vienna"  # "UTC", "Eastern Time (US & Canada)"

# set default scope for model (useful for sorting a list of items by a specific value):
# in model:
default_scope -> { order(created_at: :desc) }
# sorts itself by created_at in descending order

# destroy associated model(s) if itself is destroyed
# in model:
has_many :model, dependent: :destroy

# this is pretty neat:
time_ago_in_words(1337.days.ago)

# Chuck Norris facts with 'faker' gem, some are actually hilarious:
Faker::ChuckNorris.fact

# for ActiveRecord / model associations:
rails generate model SomeModel associatedModel_id:references
# creates 'has_many :associated_models'

# rails form file selector input:
f.file_field ...
